# Overview
>Logging system events for response and/or analysis is a major part of security operations. Logs create accountability and also provide signals to build automation systems around. With proper logging and monitoring, a SOC team can respond quickly and appropriately as events unfold.

1. Today you will begin incorporating logging capabilities into one of your existing Python tools.
2. Resources:
    * Python Logging Tutorial
    * What are stdin, stdout, stderr in Linux
    * Logging Module in Python 

## Requirements
* First, visit Python Logging Tutorial and practice the Basic Logging Tutorial.

* Next, review terminology at What Are stdin, stdout, and stderr on Linux? before visiting Logging Module in Python for some examples to get you started.

* By now, you will have created several Python scripts in your public repo. Select one of your Python tools created during this class so far that does not have a logging feature. On that tool:

1. Add logging capabilities to your Python tool using the logging library.
2. Experiment with log types. Build in some error handling, then induce some errors. Send log data to a file in the local directory.
3. Confirm your loggging feature is working as expected.
