# Nmap is a highly popular security tool used for enumeration tasks. By importing Nmap into Python we can begin to develop our own enumeration/port scanner tool.

## Today you will use Python to develop a custom Nmap scanner that can later be combined with other Python scripts to create a pentester toolkit.

This script requires Python3 and python-nmap 0.6.1.

    From a Linux VM run sudo pip3 install python-nmap to install the Nmap library for Python.
